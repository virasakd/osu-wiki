The **Community Contributors** are the people who have taken it upon themselves to provide service to the osu! community at great cost to themselves â€” tools and features that many of us take for granted today. These users are given a badge to denote that they did something notable for the entire community.

Not to be mistaken as [osu! Alumni](/wiki/People/osu!_Alumni), which are previous members of various osu! teams that retired, Community Contributor badges are given to public freelancers who had go beyond the call of duty to improve osu! and the community environment.

Contributors who registered their accounts during an older era of the game have the [original badge design](#history) on their profile, while newer contributors receive a more colourful variant.

<!-- The "Contributions" column of recent years comes from text in the linked news posts. Don't use the text on the badge itself, and don't edit any wording (besides links, etc.) -clayton -->

## History

During February 2018, the old contributor badge by ::{ flag=US }:: [RBRat3](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/307202) was redesigned by ::{ flag=JP }:: [flyte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3103765) due to not matching the new website's colour scheme.[^redesign-reasons]

![1st design change comparison](img/design-change-1.png)

Due to a lack of "soul",[^redesign-reasons] the design was changed again on 21 July 2023. This time the initial design was refreshed by ::{ flag=US }:: [RBRat3](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/307202) and split into two versions, where older contributors (with a user ID below 4,000,000) saw a revert to the original while newer contributors received a more colourful variant.
